## Project Overview
Welcome to the Smart Home IoT with ESP32 project! This initiative is about integrating various smart home sensors and actuators with the Altair® IoT Studio™ platform, providing real-time control and monitoring of your home's environment. Whether it's automating your windows, controlling fans, or monitoring security, this project brings together IoT hardware and software to create a responsive and customizable smart home experience. 

## Devices and Features 
Here are the core devices and features integrated into the smart home system:

🏠 Window & Raindrop Sensor: Remotely open/close the window and know when it rains.

🚪 Door & RFID Sensor: Control door access with RFID, and track authorized/unauthorized entries.

🔍 PIR Motion Sensor: Detects motion and triggers corresponding actions based on movement within the monitored area.

🌡️ Humidity & Temperature Sensor: Monitor environmental conditions and display them on an LCD.

🔒 Security Alerts: Track unauthorized access and receive real-time alerts.

💡 RGB LED & Fan: Control lights and fans remotely via IoT Studio.


## What You Get
By integrating the hardware in the Altair® IoT Studio™ platform, the project provides:

📊 Real-Time Monitoring: Keep tabs on various sensor data, including temperature, humidity, and window/door status.

🔐 Remote Control: Easily control home devices like fans, lights, windows, and doors via IoT Studio from anywhere.

🚨 Automated Alerts: Receive notifications for gas alarms or unauthorized RFID access attempts.

💡 Enhanced Automation: Define custom logic in IoT Studio to automate responses (e.g., closing windows when it rains or triggering alarms when gas is detected).


## How It Works
- ESP32 Development Board: The brain of the smart home, the ESP32 reads sensor data (such as humidity, temperature, and RFID access) and controls actuators (such as fans and windows).
- Data Communication: The ESP32 sends updates via MQTT to the IoT Studio platform, where the data is processed and visualized in real-time.
- IoT Studio Dashboard: Users can monitor home conditions and control devices using the IoT Studio's intuitive dashboard, offering a centralized view of the smart home.
